Figure 5A. The higher-frequency waves at the top are vibrating faster and therefore are closer to the vibratory rate of energy and less to that of matter. Moving down the scale, you can see that the slower the wavelength, the more “material” the energy becomes. Thus, the survival emotions ground us to be more like matter and less like energy. Emotions such as anger, harted, suffering, shame, guilt, judgment, and lust make us feel more physical, because they carry a frequency that is slower and more like that of physical objects. However, the more elevated emotions such as love, joy, and gratitude are higher in frequency. As a result, they are more energy-like and less physical/material

As an example, if you are overcoming a dependency on some substance such as sugar or tobacco, the more you are able to sense when the pangs and tugs of the body’s chemical addiction begin, the sooner you will be able to do battle against them. Everyone knows when the cravings start to occur. You begin to notice impulses, urges, and sometimes loud screams, which sound like, “Just do it! Submit! Give in! Go ahead—just this one time!” As you continuously forge onward and upward, in time you can notice when these cravings come up, and you will be better equipped to handle them.

Just remember that self-discipline is not self-suppression. Suppression is when you resist and fight against your desires, keeping them as buried and unexpressed as possible. Self-discipline is when your highest desires rule your lesser desires, not through resistance, but through loving action grounded in understanding and compassion.

Her ultimate desire is to feel your full consciousness, your trustable integrity, your unshakable love, and your confidence in your mission. Yet she will rarely ask you directly for these things. She would rather try to distract you from your truth, and then feel that she cannot—that you hold fast to your truth while you continue to love her.

Your woman will ask you to do all kinds of things, every day. Do not allow yourself to be swayed from your truth, from the direction of your heart. Underneath your woman’s superficial request is her actual desire and need: she wants your passionate fullness to pervade her, she wants to be able to trust the unshakability of your loving, she wants to feel in her bones that your divine masculine presence is stronger than your distractibility.

So the only time these men are affectionate is when they want to make love. But this kind of affection does not communicate, “I care about you.” Instead, it communicates, “I want sex.” Instead of giving, it’s taking. That selfish message is not lost on most women who crave affection. They deeply resent their husband’s using such an important symbol of care only for the purpose of meeting his need for sex.

Characteristically, following a climax, a woman falls back into the plateau stage and can reach another climax, if she so chooses. If she does not decide to climax again, she slowly falls back to arousal and then finally to an unaroused level. As this takes place, she feels a deep sense of peace come over her and generally has a deep desire for continuing affection

When Julia and Nate dated, it was just one long conversation. On days when they could not be together in person, they would talk on the phone, sometimes for an hour or more. They rarely planned formal dates, because their real interest lay in seeing and talking with each other. Sometimes they got so busy talking, they forgot to do whatever they had planned for the evening. But after their marriage, Julia and Nate found the number and quality of their conversations declining sharply. Both became involved in other things that took up more of their time. When they did have an opportunity to sit down and talk, Julia discovered Nate had less and less to say. When he came home from work, he generally buried his head in the newspaper, watched television, and went to bed early. It did not mean that Nate was uninterested in Julia or depressed about anything. He simply wanted to relax after a hard day at the office. “Honey,” Julia

After marriage, wives may try to interest their husband in activities more to their own liking. If their attempts fail, they may encourage their husband to continue his recreational activities without them.

A man with a need for an attractive spouse feels good whenever he looks at his attractive wife. In fact that’s what emotional needs are all about. When one of his emotional needs is met, he feels fulfilled; and when it’s not met, he feels frustrated. It may sound immature or superficial to some, but I’ve found that most men have a need for physical attractiveness. They appreciate a good-looking wife.

A woman should pay as much, if not more, attention to her choice of nightgown or pajamas as she does to what she wears in public. When she dresses for bed, she dresses strictly for her husband. Wearing old and bedraggled nightclothes, curlers, and goop on her face will not make Love Bank deposits. Wearing a worn-out nightgown to bed because “nobody will see it” misses an important point.

them miserable. Certainly they need to enjoy their own looks and feel attractive. If a husband likes something his wife can’t tolerate, negotiation is in order. Among the many hairstyles available, I’m certain they can find one on which they can agree. Hairstyles, like everything else, can create deposits or withdrawals in a husband’s Love Bank. If a wife understands her husband’s need for physical attractiveness, she will work with him to achieve that goal. In my experience, chances are great that she will find that her husband has fairly good taste. The Importance of the Right Clothes The old adage tells us, “Clothes make the man,” but in our society, clothes showcase the woman. That showcase can enhance and flatter—or do something far less than that. As with cosmetics and hairstyle, the same principle applies: dress to be attractive to your husband and comfortable with your own look. Fashions come and go, and in certain years clothing styles range from silly to disastrous. Despite the insistence of some clothes designers to be eternally creative, one rule still seems to prevail: when women’s clothing becomes unappealing to most men, it does not stay popular very long.

When you say you will clean the garage, and then weeks pass and you haven’t, her complaint isn’t really about the garage. Sure she’d like a clean garage, but this is a superficial issue. The deeper issue is that you didn’t do what you said you would. You gave her your word, and you didn’t follow through. She can’t trust what you say. And this hurts her, deeply.

The core of the feminine is energy or radiance. If she stops taking care of herself, if she becomes dull and drab, always tired and worn out, then she is unable to give you the feminine energy you desire in intimacy. You might still love her, but you will begin to look elsewhere for feminine energy.
