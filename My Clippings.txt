Figure 5A. The higher-frequency waves at the top are vibrating faster and therefore are closer to the vibratory rate of energy and less to that of matter. Moving down the scale, you can see that the slower the wavelength, the more “material” the energy becomes. Thus, the survival emotions ground us to be more like matter and less like energy. Emotions such as anger, harted, suffering, shame, guilt, judgment, and lust make us feel more physical, because they carry a frequency that is slower and more like that of physical objects. However, the more elevated emotions such as love, joy, and gratitude are higher in frequency. As a result, they are more energy-like and less physical/material

As an example, if you are overcoming a dependency on some substance such as sugar or tobacco, the more you are able to sense when the pangs and tugs of the body’s chemical addiction begin, the sooner you will be able to do battle against them. Everyone knows when the cravings start to occur. You begin to notice impulses, urges, and sometimes loud screams, which sound like, “Just do it! Submit! Give in! Go ahead—just this one time!” As you continuously forge onward and upward, in time you can notice when these cravings come up, and you will be better equipped to handle them.
